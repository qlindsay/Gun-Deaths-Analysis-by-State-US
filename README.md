# Gun-Deaths-Analysis-by-State-US

My goal with this dataset was to analyze and explore the best way to communicate this data to viewers. Although the data consists of many columns, I believe it was important to capture the data I believed to be most significant to tell the story. In other words, cutting out all of the noise.

**My goal was to answer 3 essential questions:**

1. What was the population by state?
2. What was the number of deaths by state?
3. Did I notice a positive or negative correlation between the two?

Let's begin our analysis!
Hope you enjoy! All feedback is welcomed :)

Below are visualizations from the three questions above:

**Population by State**

**CONCLUSION:**
Based on my analysis, there is in fact a strong positive correlation between Deaths and Population, showing a value of 0.89 or 89%. Therefore, as the population within a state increases, you can expect the number of deaths to increase as well. This can be due to various reasons which are outside the scope of this dataset.
